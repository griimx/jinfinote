To run the tests, they need to be transformed into HTML using XSL. Use an XSLT
processor such as Saxon <http://saxon.sourceforge.net/> with
sources/test-transform.xsl as the stylesheet. If you want to run the randomized
tests as well, use sources/test-transform-random.xsl and put the resulting
files in the "random" directory.

On Windows, you can run generate.cmd to do this for you. Be sure to adjust the
path to Saxon's Transform.exe before running it.
